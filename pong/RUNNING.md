Running the server
==================

Like all the components one should first install the required packages via `npm install`.

Running the server can then be done via `npm run start`.

Note that on its own the server does not do anything.
Inorder to be loaded by the client it must first have a entry in the Domain Space Server.

If one wants to alter the address the server runs on, this can be done in `src/index.js`.
